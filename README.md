Setup:
1) Install java and verify setup
2) Install IDE(used idea Intellij for assignment purpose)
3) Install maven and verify setup

This project uses maven as a build tool. Using maven, added selenium, testng for test execution and log4j for logging purpose.
Logs are available in application.log at the root level.

Once the system is setup, clone the repository. Let maven download all the dependencies into the local machine or manually goto maven settings and download the sources and docs.

Navigate to /src/test/java/com.ebot7.tests and right click on the package.
Select the option, Run tests in "com.ebot7.tests"

Currently using intellij ide to run the test cases. Any java supporting IDE has to be installed and the code has to be cloned into it in order to run/edit the test cases manually.
